####Features

* This is a project based on the famous windows 95, most of you remember this software that was released on 08/24/1995. This project simulates the hybrid graphical user interface with which the system worked at that time. The system works for x64/x86 processors on Windows, Linux, MacOS systems.
* The project has almost everything that the operating system had, I am not guaranteeing that it has everything since I am from the era of windows xp/vista but I tried to do all my effort.
* The project does not spend a lot of resources since it only uses typing and Javascript, it has been done as optimal as possible.
